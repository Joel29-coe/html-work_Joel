      <p>
        My name is Joel Yarney, a first year in Kwame Nkrumah Univerity of
        Science and Technology. I study Bsc. Computer Engineering as a programme
        where creativity meets technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish to one day be a great multitalented engineer and specialize in
        software development, website designing and binary coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also wish to be the best I can be and to release my full potential in
        the engineering sector. I hope to have a great stay in the school and to
        link up with the right people in order to be part of the elite students
        in the school. I also wish to understand the basics and complexes of
        hardware components and how I can use it to improve on various sectors
        such as cybersecurity and the music industry
